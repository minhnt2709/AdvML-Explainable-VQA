  Based on the provided image with bounding boxes, think step by step to generate the scene graph.
  1. Count the number of objects in the image based on the bounding boxes. Note that bounding boxes can miss some objects.
  2. Extract attributes for each object: [shape, color, size, material].
    - shape = [cube, sphere/ball, cylinder]
    - color = [red, blue, green, yellow, purple, cyan, gray, brown, orange]
    - size = [small, large]
    - material = [rubber, metal]
  3. Determine the positional relationships between each pair of objects in four directions: [right, left] and [in front, behind].
